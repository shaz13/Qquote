Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except Allah . Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
Is there any reward for good other than good?
No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah . And whoever believes in Allah – He will guide his heart. And Allah is Knowing of all things.
Say, (O Muhammad, to mankind): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
… And whoever holds firmly to Allah has [indeed] been guided to a straight path.
Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah , the Eternal Refuge.
And We have not sent you (O Muhammad SAW) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.
And incline not toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire should touch you, and you have no protectors other than Allah, nor you would then be helped.
And We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) not but as a mercy for the Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists). 
And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah].
O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.
O you who believe! be patient and excel in patience and remain steadfast, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, that you may be successful.
And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient.
